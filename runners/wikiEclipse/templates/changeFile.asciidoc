First, you want to open the file <%= contentFile; %> where you get the content from, you want to put into the new file.
Go to the file context menu in the top left corner right and choose *Open File...*. 
Based on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to your file and select it.  This can be done by, inserting the path `<%= contentPath; %>` into the path bar, so you can jump into the right folder and select the file `<%= contentFile; %>`. 
You confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner.
The file will be opened in a new Eclipse editor window where you can select the whole text with the keyboard shortcut ctrl+a or just select the text you want to copy and copy the text with ctrl+c.<% } %>

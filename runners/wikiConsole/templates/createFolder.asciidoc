Create Folder
=============


Creating a new Folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A folder can be created either from within an IDE like VSCode or Eclipse by simply right clicking in the file explorer and creating a new folder. Another approach is to use the Terminal. 

On Linux or MacOS, you can use any file explorer like Finder or execute the command `mkdir -p <%= folderPath; %>`. The `-p` flag won't throw an error if the target folder already exists and allows the creation of parent directories.

On Windows, you can use the Windows Explorer to create folders or use the batch command `if not exist <%= folderPath; %> mkdir <%= folderPath; %>`.
